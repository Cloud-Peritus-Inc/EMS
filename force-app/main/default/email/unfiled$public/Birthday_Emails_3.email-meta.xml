    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

We all know that you are a hardworking and dedicated employee, and we appreciate everything you do for our team. However, today is your day to forget about work and celebrate your birthday with wild abandon. Let&apos;s make some unforgettable memories, laugh until our bellies hurt, and dance like there&apos;s no tomorrow!


Happy birthday from all of us at Cloud Peritus. May this year bring you everything you desire, both personally and professionally.


Regards,

The Cloud Peritus Team</textOnly>
