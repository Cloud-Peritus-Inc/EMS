    <subject>Cloud Peritus: Welcome to Cloud Peritus!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},


Hope you are doing well. Are you excited to finally start working with all us cool folks? I bet you are as much as we are to welcome you at Cloud Peritus. Here are a few instructions and tips for you to ride the first day like a champion.




We can&apos;t wait to have you join us at Cloud Peritus. We will be expecting your virtual/physical (whichever was decided) presence tomorrow i.e {!Contact.EMS_EM_JD__c} at 11.00 AM. An HR executive will reach out and guide you on Day 1 for the onboarding process. The onboarding program has been designed to give you the necessary information about our culture, company goals, and give you a sense of how we operate. It will help you acclimate to this new chapter with ease. You will all be meeting your buddy and manager to help you get settled on your first day.


You&apos;d need to carry soft copies of all identity/education/work related documents and a passport-size photo. We&apos;d suggest that you store all the documents you need on your personal Google Drive; you will get your work laptop on the day you join and you&apos;ll be able to access it from there.
