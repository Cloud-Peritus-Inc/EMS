    <textOnly>Dear {!EMS_TM_Project__c.Project_Manager__c},


The project {!EMS_TM_Project__c.Name} is nearing completion with the end date on {!EMS_TM_Project__c.EMS_TM_EndDate__c}. Please change the end date of the project to extend it, if required. In case there is no extension, then make sure to change the status of the project to &apos;Completed&apos; on the end date so that the associated assignments are closed. You can find the project record here.
