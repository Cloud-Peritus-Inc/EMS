    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

It&apos;s not every day that we get to celebrate the birthday of someone as awesome as you. Your commitment to excellence and your positive attitude inspire us to do better every day. So, today, we want you to take a break, let loose, and have some fun. Dance like nobody&apos;s watching, sing like nobody&apos;s listening, and laugh like there&apos;s no tomorrow!


Happy birthday from all of us at Cloud Peritus. May this year be filled with lots of joy, good health, and success.


Regards,

The Cloud Peritus Team</textOnly>
